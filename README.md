# IRC
A simple IRC server and clients

PrivateMessaging programmed and working. There is a minor error as far as output goes which im assuming is in the Client Code where it prints "@john hello" on Johns app as "John > hello" where it should be "sender > hello".Takes targetUsername and SenderUsername for output. Otherwise DM works fine and am getting back to working on Channels.

Channel Classes started programming but unsure how to impement in a way which makes sense for the project. Will get back To programming Channel after programming the PrivateMessaging and see if the group have any ideas on the Channel Implementation.
