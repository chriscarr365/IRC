# IRC
A simple IRC server and clients

PrivateMessaging programmed and half working, needs Debugging as logic error remain. DM sends to only one client now rather than broadcasting to every client, however the one client it sends the message to is incorrect as it always sends DMs from any user to the most recent connected client(even if the DM is sent from the most recent client)

Channel Classes started programming but unsure how to impement in a way which makes sense for the project. Will get back To programming Channel after programming the PrivateMessaging and see if the group have any ideas on the Channel Implementation.
